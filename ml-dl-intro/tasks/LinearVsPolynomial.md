# Notable comparisons between linear and polynomial regression:

1. Linear regression creates a simple straight line graph for datasets with mostly linear data points, while polynomial regression creates a more complex, polynomial function according to the degree of the equation provided. 
2. Linear regression tended to a great overfitting, while polynomial regression has tended to less overfitting in the datasets trained/tested with.
3. Both seem to be less sensitive to outliers, but polynomial regression is more likely to be sensitive to outliers. 
4. Because data points are not evenly distributed, there seems to be better regression models to use for such data.
